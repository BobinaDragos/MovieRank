A pluralsight .NET DynamoDB course practice

This is a personal project that I created following the course:

Developing .NET Core 3 Applications with DynamoDB on AWS on PluralSight (https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/aws-dotnet-core-developing-applications-dynamodb)

I used .NET Core 5 instead of 3 for this project.
